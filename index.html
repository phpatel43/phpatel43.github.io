        <p> Hello, my name is Preetesh Patel but I also go by "P2". I live in Belmont which is right outside of Charlotte. I went to South Point high school, home of the Red Raiders. Then I did two semesters at UNC-Wilington. I played football for around eight years and then played some intramural flag football in my first semester in which we won the championship as freshman. I love the sport of football and I also enjoy playing video games and occasionally like to go fishing. 
            Now, I am a beginner coder and am excited to learn about back-end development! </p>
